				<p>Yoga (/ˈjoʊɡə/;[1] Sanskrit: योग; About this soundpronunciation) is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. Yoga is one of the six Āstika (orthodox) schools of Hindu philosophical traditions.[2]

				There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals[3] in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.[4][5][6] The term "Yoga" in the Western world often denotes a modern form of hatha yoga and yoga as exercise, consisting largely of the postures or asanas.

				The practice of yoga has been thought to date back to pre-vedic Indian traditions; possibly in the Indus valley civilization around 3000 BCE. Yoga is mentioned in the Rigveda,[note 1] and also referenced in the Upanishads,[8][9] . Although, yoga most likely developed as a systematic study around the 5th and 6th centuries BCE, in ancient India's ascetic and śramaṇa movements.[10][note 2] The chronology of earliest texts describing yoga-practices is unclear, varyingly credited to the Upanishads.[11] The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali date from the 2nd century BCE,[12][13] and gained prominence in the west in the 20th century after being first introduced by Swami Vivekananda.[14] Hatha yoga texts began to emerge sometime between the 9th and 11th century with origins in tantra.[15][16]
				

				Yoga gurus from India later introduced yoga to the West,[17] following the success of Swami Vivekananda in the late 19th and early 20th century with his adaptation of yoga tradition, excluding asanas.[17] Outside India, it has developed into a posture-based physical fitness, stress-relief and relaxation technique.[18] Yoga in Indian traditions, however, is more than physical exercise; it has a meditative and spiritual core.[18][19] One of the six major orthodox schools of Hinduism is also called Yoga, which has its own epistemology, ontology and metaphysics, and is closely related to Hindu Samkhya philosophy.[20]</p>
